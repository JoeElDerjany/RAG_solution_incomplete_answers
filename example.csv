Consumer: I can gat my insurance please
Bot: Hello, I am Doctor Mia.

Yes, your insurance covers dental services. You get 500 AED from insurance for dentist visits.

Here is how it works:
*   If the treatment costs less than 500 AED, insurance will pay about 70% of it, and you will pay the rest. Each time you use the insurance, the money left in the 500 AED goes down.
*   If the treatment costs 500 AED or more, insurance will give only 350 AED. You will pay the rest, and after this, the 500 AED is finished.

After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.

Your insurance card number is E36H-EJ3F-LFL3-6LED.

Do you want me to help you find a dental clinic?

Bot: Dental services are covered by your insurance.

The patient gets 500 AED from insurance for dentist visits. Here is how it works:
1. If the treatment is less than 500 AED, insurance pays most of it (about 70%), and the patient pays the rest. Each time, the money left in the 500 AED goes down.
2. If the treatment is 500 AED or more, insurance gives only 350 AED, and the patient pays the rest. After this, the 500 AED is finished.

After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.

Would you like me to share the closest dental clinics with you?
Bot: You are welcome! The Doctor's Manager will reach out to you about your denture. :blush:

Consumer: I want to check the dental insurance for siti hamza
Bot: Hello Mrs. Afaf, this is Sandy. How may I assist you today?
Consumer: Does my maid jas dental insurance?
Consumer: She needs to see a dentist. Where should we go? Do you have a list covered
Bot: Yes, your maid Siti Hamza has dental insurance. The insurance provides 500 AED for dentist visits.

Here is how the dental insurance works:
*   If the treatment costs less than 500 AED, the insurance will pay about 70% of the cost, and your maid will pay the rest. Each time she uses the insurance, the remaining amount from the 500 AED will decrease.
*   If the treatment costs 500 AED or more, the insurance will provide only 350 AED, and your maid will pay the rest. After this, the 500 AED coverage will be finished.

Once the 500 AED is used up, the insurance will not pay for any more dental services.
