Consumer: Jupiter clinic referred us to aster hospital and u guys are saying it's not covered what do u really want a person in pain to do"
CH2c29500dfb2e4ba4822d05ba3bf797de,Doctor,Amal Abdellah,"Agent: I am sorry to hear that to be able for her to do surgery, she needs to follow these steps.
1- She needs to see a GP.
2- See the gynecologist specialist.
3- The specialist should provide you with a referral letter if she needs a surgery.
Did she did all of the above?
Jupter clinic has a GP and gynecologist.
Consumer: She already did 1
Consumer: The gynaec was not available at jupiter
Consumer: So the GP at Jupiter referred her to a gynaec at aster mankhool hospital
Consumer: The gynaec as aster mankhool recommended the surgical procedure
Consumer: We are currently waiting for insurance approval at the hospital
Consumer: If none of your approved clinics have an available gynaec how do u expect the poor girl to live with pain level 9 on 10
Consumer: We went to the GP on 10th and nobody referred her correctly immediately to a gynaec we waited 2 days in pain when I consistently followed up
Agent: She should always visit a clinic to see a specialist first; this is the insurance protocol.
Based on what I understood from you you did the specialist consultation at the hospital already.
In this case, you will need to wait for the insurance company to approve the claim.
Consumer: She idd my dearrrr
Consumer: We went to Jupiter first
Consumer: Which was the clinic maids told me
Consumer: I have repeated this 10 times since morning
Consumer: We went to a clinic
Consumer: The clinic referred us to a gynaec in a hospital
Consumer: Because they didn't have a specialist
Consumer: If ur network is so poor how do u want us to function
Consumer: My nanny is lucky I can have this conversation
Consumer: If they are lonely they cannot even do all this
Consumer: U are a maids support agency
Consumer: And your support is horrific
Consumer: They dont know English
Consumer: N u expect them to go through hoops when they are sick
Consumer: The employers are paying u good fees
Consumer: For this service
Agent: because she might not covered if she visit a specialist at the hospital but it's fine
Consumer: Can u pls help push for approval
Consumer: Its been 2 hrs
Consumer: We have raised an emergency request as per protocol
Consumer: N there's no upsate
Consumer: I was at the hospital since 1130
Agent: Usually, inpatient approvals need 24 hours to be evaluated this is Nas protocol.
Consumer: Not incase of emergency
Consumer: They told me
Agent: Usually in case of life threatening emergency the hospital follow something called emergency protocol however her case is not a life threatening case this is why she needs to wait for approval.
You can also check with the hospital.
Consumer: Ok but how do we proceed
Consumer: This is a joke
Agent: As I told you claim approvals needs around 24 hours for inpatient, if you want you can leave the hospital will call you if the claim is approved.
Consumer: But then will it still be emergency
Agent: No it is not life threatening.
Consumer: This is my issue
Consumer: Ur clarity is abysmal
Consumer: Does she have to die
Consumer: To get treatment
Consumer: She is in pain
Consumer: Ur network doesn't have treatment options
Consumer: I called all the clinics
Consumer: None of them do the process
Consumer: We got referral to this hospital insurance rejected it
Consumer: R u guys for real
Consumer: I rather get a visa from the government and oay for my own insurance than work with such terrible agencies
Consumer: U rather a poor employee die to get treatment

Consumer: Ur network doesnt treat anything !

Consumer: Can u tell me the next steps pls
Consumer: Sudha has not received any treatment except painkillers
Consumer: I need a list of clinics with gynaecologist available for tomorrow morning urgently who can readily request for and approve a surgical procedure
Consumer: Can u atlesst give me a confirmed list"
CH2c29500dfb2e4ba4822d05ba3bf797de,Doctor,Leen Rizk,"Agent: She should visit a specialist at the clinic. I can recommend a clinic that has a gynecologist, who can provide a referral for surgery if necessary.
Consumer: Yes pls do so
Consumer: But a clinic that can give a referral that will get approved
Consumer: Not like today
Consumer: And a clinic that has approval to give such a referral because then u will say this hospital is not allowed etc
Agent: Sure, allow me a moment, please.
Also, I want you to know that, to my knowledge, Jupiter has a gynecologist â you can book an appointment with him. In any case, I will provide you with a clinic that has the appropriate specialist. Just make sure she brings a GP referral with her.
Consumer: Yes Jupiter has one
Consumer: Who wss not available
Consumer: And Jupiter cannot perform the procedure
Consumer: They dont have the ability
Consumer: They will refer us to aster mankhool agaon
Consumer: And it will be rejected again
Consumer: So that's a circus I want to avoid
Agent: Thank you for letting me know.
Yes, the procedure should be done at a hospital, but the specialist at the clinic is the one she should consult first. He will provide the necessary referral for the surgery at the hospital. Iâll send you the details of the specialist shortly.
Consumer: Ok which is fine but the specialist should also know the hospitals to refer to right? We don't want u to then say this is not life threatening so this hospital is not ok
Agent: Sure, thatâs right.
If the specialist provides her with a referral for the surgery, it should be covered by the insurance.

For your watery runny nose, I recommend using a saline nasal spray like ""Physiomer"" or ""Sinomarin."" You can spray 1-2 puffs into each nostril 2-3 times a day. This will help to clear your nasal passages.

Here is some lifestyle advice to help you feel better:
*   Drink plenty of warm liquids like water or tea.
*   Get enough rest to help your body recover.
*   Avoid dust and other things that might trigger your allergy.
*   Continue to wear your mask to help manage the runny nose.

Your runny nose should start to improve within 7 to 10 days. If your symptoms do not get better or if they get worse, please let me know.

2. If the treatment is 500 AED or more, insurance gives only 350 AED, and the patient pays the rest. After this, the 500 AED is finished.
After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.

After you get the referral letter from a general clinic, you can go to see the specialist c and show it to them so that the insurance covers the cost of your visit. Remember that your insurance covers 80% of your visit.

CHfa6adedf912e4b788300fa70ea4ec347,GPT_Doctors,BOT,"Consumer: Hi good morning doc
Consumer: I have result for my Cbc and I don't know how to understand
Bot: Hi good morning. Please tell me what your CBC results say so I can help you understand them.
Consumer: nan
Bot: Thank you for sharing your results. Your blood test shows that your hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and MCHC are a little low, and your RDW is a little high. This means you have a type of anemia, which is a condition where your blood has fewer healthy red blood cells.

Based on these results, a clinic visit is not required at this time. I recommend you take an iron supplement to help improve your red blood cell levels. You can take **Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg tablets** once a day with food.

Here is some lifestyle advice that can help:
*   Eat foods rich in iron, such as red meat, beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals.
*   Eat foods rich in Vitamin C, like oranges, strawberries, and bell peppers, as Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron.
*   Avoid drinking tea or coffee with meals, as they can reduce iron absorption.
*   Get enough rest.

Do you have any known chronic conditions or allergies?

Consumer: It's I drink that medicine doc even I drink medicine for my high blood pressure
Bot: Thank you for letting me know you are taking medicine for high blood pressure. Since you have a chronic condition, it is best to have a doctor check your overall health.

Please tell me your full address, including the street, building, and city, so I can help you find the nearest clinics.
Consumer: Doc I have vitamins here for my hemoglobin before but I stop drinking it when I start my medicine for blood pressure
Bot: It is important to discuss all your medicines, including the vitamins for hemoglobin and your blood pressure medicine, with a doctor. They can help you understand how to manage both your high blood pressure and your anemia safely.

Please tell me your full address, including the street, building, and city, so I can help you find the nearest clinics.
