Bot: Dental insurance covers dental consultation, extraction, fillings, root canal treatment, scaling, X-rays, antibiotics, and prophylaxis.

Bot: For a dental clinic, it's best to see a dentist. We can help you find the nearest dental clinic.

The patient gets 500 AED from insurance for dentist visits. Here’s how it works:
1. If the treatment is cheap (less than 500 AED):
   - Insurance pays most of it (about 70%).
   - The patient pays the rest.
   - Each time, the money left in the 500 AED goes down.
2. If the treatment is expensive (500 AED or more):
   - Insurance gives only 350 AED.
   - The patient pays the rest.
   - After this, the 500 AED is finished.

After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.

Please share your full address (street, apartment, city) so I can find the nearest dental clinics for you.

Consumer: I have pain in my tooth so I will go to the dental clinic directly
Bot: For a toothache, it is best to see a dentist. The patient gets 500 AED from insurance for dentist visits.

Here is how it works:
* If the treatment is less than 500 AED, the insurance pays about 70% of it, and you pay the rest. Each time, the money left in the 500 AED goes down.
* If the treatment is 500 AED or more, the insurance gives only 350 AED, and you pay the rest. After this, the 500 AED is finished.
* After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.

The patient's insurance card number is 2KFM-M33F-LFLM-KLED.

Bot: The insurance will cover 80% of clinic visits, and 70% of the cost if you get medicine from the clinic with a prescription. The insurance is under NAS managed by Orient. Your insurance card number is MFF2-3M3F-LFLJ-KLED.

To help you best, can you please tell me what symptoms you are experiencing?
Consumer: Is dental check up covered by the insurance?
Bot: Dental consultation, Extraction, Fillings, Root canal treatment, Scaling, X-rays, Antibiotics, and Prophylaxis are covered by the insurance.

You get 500 AED from insurance for dentist visits. Here is how it works:
* If the treatment is less than 500 AED, insurance pays about 70% and you pay the rest. Each time, the money left in the 500 AED goes down.
* If the treatment is 500 AED or more, insurance gives only 350 AED and you pay the rest. After this, the 500 AED is finished.

After the 500 AED is used up, insurance will not pay anymore.
Consumer: Okay thank you
